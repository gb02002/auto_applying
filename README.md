# Auto_applying
Automation for applying. Should work with LinkedIn, hh.ru, telegram. It opens post, you read desc, combine Cover Letter and it commits it.

## Setting up

Project has two main parts: web_interaction(selenium + telethon) and letter combiner. In main.py from input you can choose which part you want to use accordint to cli hints.

Good setup, docs and requirements will be added after the project will be considered finished.

Cheers.
